<h2>Business Insights</h2>

<h4>4.1 The sales value varies for the same product, potentially reaching over 500%, and a lower volume is not necessarily related to a higher price.</h4>
This observation suggests that sales volume loses some of its relevance as an indicator of profitability, emphasizing the importance of profit margin %. This opens the door to further analysis, such as price optimization, customer segmentation, and discount strategies.
<h4>4.2 Sales distribution is uniform across various perspectives, indicating temporal stability and diversity in products and sellers.</h4>
In this case, it is challenging to identify a specific sales driver, and Pareto assumptions may not be applicable.
<h4>4.3 There is a risk of profit loss; a small variation in margins can make the company more vulnerable to cost-related factors.</h4>
Given the low variation in margin %, it is advisable to expand marketing or product sales strategies, such as seasonal promotions, bundles and packages, and upselling or cross-selling strategies.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
The analysis provides valuable insights into product performance, pricing dynamics, and sales evolution. Recommendations include a focus on profit margins, exploration of pricing optimization and marketing strategies, and consideration of potential risks to profitability. The creation of a visual dashboard facilitates ongoing monitoring and informed decision-making
